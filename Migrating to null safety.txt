Migrating to null safety

In pubspec.yaml:

environment:
  sdk: ">=2.12.0 <3.0.0"
#  sdk: ">=2.7.0 <3.0.0"  # Without null safety

$ flutter pub upgrade --major-versions

Changed 2 constraints in pubspec.yaml:
  provider: ^4.3.2+2 -> ^6.1.2
  path_provider: ^1.6.21 -> ^2.1.2

LOTS of red errors in Dart Analysis...
